--

On May 16, 2010, a WWII plane wreckage is discovered in Greenland. Two days later, during the excavation and investigation, a body is found comatose, protected from the elements by the plane's body. The woman is transferred to S.H.I.E.L.D. after investigation, and nine days after her discovery, wakes up.

It is discovered that her name is Amy Lamel. Amy claims to be no one special, just someone upon whom a miracle fell. But in reality, she holds an impressive stack of accomplishments: incredible aim with most guns; well-trained in hand-to-hand combat; well-versed in engineering; a member of the Army Nurse Corps and respected medical professional; and the would-be fiance of Howard Stark, had she survived the war in the usual manner.

Now Amy has to face a world where the man she loved is dead and society has evolved, and learn how to deal with all of her experiences without giving away her true past.

One of these ""rules"" for living in the modern world will be broken. Whose fault it is, and how it happens? Well, that's a whole 'nother story.

 Everyone knows that losing friends is a natural part of the high school experience.  Yet, what happens when a friend doesn't intentionally ""go ghost"" but is abruptly taken away?
         Kameron, Grayson, Mikey, Yasmin, and Jenna have been thick as thieves from childhood. Rightfully so-they make up the American minority in the German twin city of Arabella Park. When one of the five suddenly turns up missing, the remaining friends must find a way to bring her back while keeping up the facade of leading ordinary small-town lives. 
        As they search for their missing friend, they discover things about themselves and one another that will catapult them into an explosive climax and the ultimate revelation of who done it.

Besides, he wants to forget what happened to Tomoyuki, Mark, Carlos, James and his other identities. They remind him of a past he tries to erase.

But can he really forget something that shaped him for who he is right now? Can he escape a life he did not choose but was born into?

Carlos?
James?
Trey?

Who is he trying to kid?

He is not Trey.

He is no one.

He is a man with No Name, No Face.

Sarah Jensen is a fresh graduate form college and has the heart of an angel. She always tries to look at the positive. She gets spooked easily but won't be afraid to stick up for herself.

He never thought he needed love until he met Sarah. He thought she was just an ordinary girl until he learns  more about her past.

Mystery, love, confusion, fear, sadness, and so much more lies ahead for these two. Sarah will soon learn the dangers that men like this hold. But once she allows him to take her heart she will have no choice but to never go back to the old life she knew. He will be forced to never let her go. After all, he is the mafia gang leader.

140619788,"Sin Nombre, Sin Rostro","Trey has been changing names and faces since he became an official member of the group. And yes, Trey, is not his real name, and his face, is not his original face. But he liked this one, this particular identity. So for years, he has been Trey. Just Trey.

Besides, he wants to forget what happened to Tomoyuki, Mark, Carlos, James and his other identities. They remind him of a past he tries to erase.

But can he really forget something that shaped him for who he is right now? Can he escape a life he did not choose but was born into?

And who is he really?
Tomoyuki?
Mark?
Carlos?
James?
Trey?

Who is he trying to kid?

He is not Trey.

He is no one.

He is a man with No Name, No Face.

I winked and walked away from him, swaying my hips with every step, making half the boys at this party stop and stare. 

Passing Maya, I skipped over to the bar. I looked over at her, winked, and downed another shot of Whiskey.

It was a game Arden and her best friend created. 
For the whole summer, they could only get drunk off Whiskey, no getting drunk off love. 

It worked. Everything was turning out fine, until one night at a house party when everything went crazy. Shots were taken, secrets were told, things happened. 


He was her light when all she saw was darkness. When she was stuck in a horrible place, outside her friend's house, completely drunk, with nowhere to go.

She is Arden Smith.
He is Apollo Tyler.

Right?

Right. 

That's what Athena wanted to do.

So she went for a walk and got lost...

Just when she thinks she found hope of returning back home she gets kidnapped. 

Athena can be stupid but this girl has got guts. She figures away to escape but being cocky is in her personality. So, she wants to brag to her kidnappers. When she does, they come looking for her. 

She didn't know that she crossed a territory that was not hers to cross.

Soon, her kidnappers kidnap her again. Only, this time it's harder to escape. She's locked in a dungeon all alone. 

She doesn't know, that she's going into unfamiliar territory (literally and figuratively). 

ONE MORE THING, SHE FINDS HER SOUL MATE!

138931526,BAD BOY'S BABY | KOOKV ,"""Daddy."" 

Jungkook spit out his water all over the table, coughing as he tried to regain his breath. 

""Excuse me?"" He asked as he looked at an innocent Taehyung, who seemed to not understand the word that just left him mouth. 

""It's what Jin calls Namjoonie.""

---

Jungkook is the school bad boy and overall is dangerous. He's involved in gangs and is one of the most feared people in school. One day he does something that nearly gets him expelled but gets an offer. The offer stated that if he helped out the schools ""special"" class his actions would be forgotten. 

Of course he takes up that offer but what if he gets assigned to Taehyung? 

Taehyung has CDD - a disorder that causes him to act like a child. He's very dependent on other people because of this and is pretty innocent because of his overprotective brother.

As soon as they meet their lives intertwine.

What will happen to the couple?

But then here comes possibly the prettiest boy he had ever seen. Jordan. But Jordan isn't the pretty boy he seems. He's got the looks but his underlying plan is to break whoever this stuttering bitch is. To get back at someone personally is way different than hurting who they love most. 
It's cruel and Jordan knows it, that's why he dangles Damian like an ornament on a Christmas right before the boy who loves him most, and let's him shatter on the hardwood floors.

134064480,Malevolent Masquerade [Yandere Student Council x reader],"The devil is alluring, addictive - he lures one in gently, enticing them with honeyed words and false promises. Why, he captivated a third of his fellow angels, bewitching them with his diabolical charm. However, many of those who have fallen victim to his enamoring temptations are not truly at fault. For Lucifer lurks in the dark, plotting behind a mask of shadows and a faultless exterior. That he might be merely playing the role of friend was a thought one would deem inconceivable.

But the devil is not alone in his hiding, for you, too, disguised your true self. You acted out the happy grandchild; the grade A, model student. You preformed as the brave, happy go lucky friend - someone people knew they could always count on to be there for them, through thick and thin. All those things, the people around you expected you to be, and so you played the parts with nimble, refined grace, dolefully accepting the labels and positions you'd been assigned.

Your every action- every word, every step- you would calculate perfectly beforehand, petrified by the possibility of being caught and exposed for what you truly are: a downcast, forlorn soul, with no more spirit than a mindless marionette.

But man can not compare to the devil's skill in show - you can't defeat the puppeteers at their own game. It is far too twisted and mystifying of a dance for you to keep up your flawless facade.

I bid you good luck, human. You'll need it, in this dark, malevolent masquerade.",https://www.wattpad.com/story/134064480-malevolent-masquerade-yandere-student-council-x,2018-01-03T14:37:05Z,2018-03-13T23:47:11Z,False,1,False,1102,6,Fanfiction,1,English,True,4,"['anime', 'crazy', 'fanfiction', 'horror', 'insane', 'killer', 'manga', 'psycopath', 'reader', 'serialkiller', 'sociopath', 'thriller', 'xreader', 'yandere']",0,0,0,https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/f-a-n-t-a-s-i-e-s.128.95882.jpg,,f-a-n-t-a-s-i-e-s

___

You know Quinn Demitrius, everyone does. Perhaps you've seen her on the covers of Vogue, on the TV wining a Grammy or even shopping on fifth Avenue with her beloved sisters. She's Hollywood's hottest starlet, and the things she did to become the name on everyone's lips are merely stains on the pavement beneath her Prada heels.

Sebastian Bishop, the mysterious actor with an even more confusing past. Sebastian has a hitlist, but not the murder kind. Instead he has a list of people who he's hell bent on destroying with Quinn's Demitrius name written in red underline. 

With the rest if Hollywood's golden brat pack, an entire fake relationship, a mysterious blogger exposing Hollywood's elites dirty laundry, drama, scandals,cute moments and a sinful amount of bittersweet kisses.

Bittersweet Kisses is a story bound to tug on your heartstrings.

7647757,An Unusual Mate,"Brooklyn Kelly or Brooke for short is a part of the Talkeetna Shifter Clan in Alaska because she is a shifter. She can shift into a Snow Leopard that is rather feral in character meaning the Brooklyn has little to no control over whatever her Leopard does meaning that not many people would see her as a good mate. As such Brooklyn has pretty much given up on ever finding her true mate because she wouldn’t be able to accept him as her mate because of her Snow Leopard. What really annoys her though is that the way her Snow Leopard is now wasn’t caused by her genetics it was caused by her rubbish upbringing along with her two sibling’s upbringing. 
When Loki the God of Mischief is quite literally dumped onto the clan’s doorstep Brooklyn begins to feel things that she wouldn’t have even thought she could feel and the same goes for her Snow Leopard. Well at first Brooklyn ignores Loki pretty much and argues with him to no end but as time goes on and they begin to become friends Brooklyn soon realises that her feelings for Loki are set deep within herself.
But when S.H.I.E.L.D finds out that Loki is in Alaska and has been accepted into the clan all hell basically breaks loose with Nick Fury sending the Avengers to retrieve Loki. But when Brooklyn also gets caught up in the cross fire and is taken back to S.H.I.E.L.D her Leopard turns rouge and Brooklyn looses all control and she can’t even shift back. Nick Fury eventually agrees to let Loki in with the already rouge Snow Leopard only to see if she can be calmed down.
What will happen to Brooklyn? Will she calm down? Will Loki be allowed to remain a part of the clan?
Warning: Contains a very expressive woman who swears like a sailor. A sarcastic God of Mischief. A very aggressive Snow Leopard and some scenes of the sexual nature.",https://www.wattpad.com/story/7647757-an-unusual-mate,2013-08-14T19:01:11Z,2018-03-13T23:46:16Z,False,30,False,422768,6,Fanfiction,1,English,False,3,"['alaska', 'avengers', 'bifrost', 'clans', 'leopard', 'leopards', 'loki', 'marvel', 'packs', 'shifters', 'snow', 'swearing']",107,14893,671,https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/KatieMayBloomfield.128.267160.jpg,Katie May Bloomfield,KatieMayBloomfield

Every star is important to defend their Mother Sun and to prolong its life or else, the Great Doom will happen.

Meanwhile, two stars, Altair from Aquila and Chara from Canes Venatici, write paperstars to their own starmates-- a forbidden belief in their kind. Anyone who will be caught doing this will be cursed to become a slave until the end of their life. 

But Altair and Chara believe in paperstars and when they fill their star jars, they will meet their starmates and will be collided with them forever.

But what if they get caught? What if the paperstars is just a myth?

Aizowa Azayaka was abandoned at the age of 7 after her father died and her mother found out she couldn't control her quirk.

When found she was sent away to QCF or the quirk control facility for kids who have been abandoned and need help as they can't control their quirks or have major problems with them.

Ai is now 15 and is being forced, along with the rest of her class, to train at UA. But maybe this could finally be Ai's way out of the QCF.

WARNING STRONG LANGUAGE AND THEMES THROUGH OUT THE BOOK DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO THIS.

Also I don't own BNHA or any of its characters I only own the ones I've made and I have used the same name from my previous books so if you don't like that I've done that let me know and suggest some names I could use thank you.

133729137,Divided,"SEQUEL TO UNITED

""This is not a civil war."" 

""Then what is it?""

""The end of the Avengers Initiative."" 
***
It's been almost two years since the Revengers first landed their ship on Midgard. New recruits have joined the Avengers, while Asgard thrives in secrecy, shrouded from the rest of the Earth. Overall, it's been an eventful,  but memorable two years. Everyone is finally happy.

That is, until two brothers discover the Eye of Agamotto, and a way to bring Frigga back to life. Traveling in time, of course, has its undesirable effects, and Thor and Loki soon find themselves trapped on Asgard while the Avengers are nothing more than broken memories of the past. 

One thing is for certain. Even if they are able to restore their original timeline, they must live with the knowledge that one thing is for certain.

Nothing will ever be the same again.

•-•-•

❝You know, most girls directly tell me if they like me. You stumble into a door, trip over air, and then end up somehow kissing me.❞

•-•-•

Blaire Collins has a curse.

A curse that goes by the name of clumsiness.

Despite being confident and bold, she tumbles over anything and everything; whether it's furniture or air, Blaire is almost positive that no one can beat her when it comes to her eternal embarrassment of being a klutz. 

So, when her so-called 'curse' causes her to trip onto River Knight, the academy's richest student, and end up locking lips with him, Blaire is absolutely mortified and is sure that the rest of her life will end up with her digging herself into a hole and never coming out. 

After all, a boy like him is sure to take every chance he can get to embarrass her over the incident, right?

Wrong.

Instead of doing what most people would do, River decides to befriend the clumsy yet confident girl.

And somewhere along the way, he realizes that maybe another kiss with her won't be so bad.

She coincidentally crosses paths her former best friend Archer Silva who ditched her for popularity - he too has gone through a change.

He was no longer the rather chubby boy with a round face and coconut hairstyle. His appearance changed massively, his hair was now styled into a quiff, enhancing the colour of his tousled brown hair. His facial structures were more defined.

Malia has plans for Archer and the rest of her former high-school classmates, she wanted them to realise how it felt to be left out.

Amelia has always been the independent and strong minded girl that everybody has picked her out to be. Owning your own firm can do that to a person and she knew what she was getting herself into. However, losing her fiance was not part of the plan. Now Amelia is running a firm all on her own. That is until she's dragged to a formal, or ball as they like to call it, by one of her closets friends and his cousin to loosen up a bit.

Theo has never had to work for anything in his life. Being born as the heir of a multi-million company has made that possible. Also with the help of being devilish handsome, brilliant, a billionaire, and having a body that anybody would love to worship. Except, rumor has it that he's a vile, tyrant, and heartless boss. Expects nothing but perfection, and if you fail, you're fired by the snaps of his fingers. Fear is the only thing his colleagues feel about him, and god forbid if anybody disrespected Theo. However, for someone who expects perfection he certainly didn't intend to find the imperfect Amelia Ponce.

While both are exceedingly successful at what they do, they both seem to be at a lost when it comes to love. In fact, not one of them believes in it, that is until they meet each other at the ""ball."" But there's a catch, neither of them know each other's name.

Soulmates where tied by two things: A Voice or touch, and flowers. 

When two soulmates where born, flowers would bloom in a place of their body, wrapping around it, growing on it, sometimes causing the disability of it. These flowers would only disappear by a Kiss for Lovers, by a hug for best friends(in case the person in question was Asexual/Aromantic). But what happens when someone Blind is meant to be the soulmate of someone mute?

The Cup brothers were also put to this rule like everyone else. The older a blind at young age, the younger born with flowers on his legs, luckily, not stopping his movement. And even like that, they managed to defeat the devil, a man blind by an eye, and a mute casino manager that turned the place he once called his, back to his old glory.

I stared at the helmeted guy, who quickly stood up. ""Watch where you're--"" He shouted angrily, but stopped short.

I looked at the guy, confused as he stood there, staring at me through his blacked-out helmet.

Then, in a swift motion, he wrapped his arms around me tightly. I screamed, pushing myself off of him.

He released me, stepping back a bit. He stared back at me, confused. He quickly pulled off his helmet to reveal his face. I looked at the brown-haired boy, frozen for what felt like the hundredth time today.

133685041,Muggle-worthy | GINNY WEASLEY,"Quinton Granger was very much like his younger sister, Hermione Jean Granger, well known for his studious nature among peers. However, there was a significant difference between the two, unlike Hermione, Quinton didn't possess magic.

He was a muggle.

Arthur Weasley has always been fascinated by muggles and their lifestyle, so when he meets Quinton one year as the older brother drops Hermione off at King's Cross, the two strike up a conversation about the function of a rubber duck. The two became fast friends and Quinton becomes a regular at the Burrow whenever his sister is invited over.

Ginny is trying to come to terms with her feelings over the Boy-Who-Lived, who doesn't pay her any sort of mind outside of being Ron's little sister. Hermione gives her the advice not to pine over Harry, that she should look at other boys, although when Hermione suggested it, she wasn't exactly suggesting her older brother.

It started off as letters between the two while Ginny is at school and becomes something each time the two see each other again.

126011866,The Vampire's Kiss,"We all have heard of our own share of people and creatures. But there is one more you have yet to hear about, these people have a very.....unnatural religion. Its people are united under one name, despite their inexplicably incomparable devotion; they are among the unholiest creations of God. The Vampiric Empire.

 18-year-old Andie Jordonson lives in a closed off city that feared creatures of the undead. The rules there were simple: no one goes in, no one goes out. But Creation had mercy on these people, as if to repay their generosity, each living being there was granted with unique powers to protect themselves against the vampires. The abilities usually show when they are 16, but Andie is still waiting at the age of 18. 

The city officials believed their work was done as they had just killed off all traces of the unholy community. Until one day, the most unlikely person in the world spoke out to the public. The Vampire Queen.

Or better known as, the Living Dark.

Her disciples are pitted against the human race, each vampire (in addition to their fangs) has their lips tainted in a deadly poison to paralyze their victims before sucking the blood out of them.

The Queen never goes out in public to carry out her own deeds, her disciples do all of her dirty work for her, Andie learns that she still had many supporters; so why does she suddenly decide to catch the attention of the public? Riled with curiosity and mourning a loss, Andie feels she has the need to prove herself, but she is ignorant to the cost; and the fact she hasn't unlocked her abilities yet. Then she will find herself sucked into a blood pool of madness, with the most heart accelerating surprise any mystery book fan could ever dream for.


I will help you along the way, in between the parts I will be giving you clues as to who the Living Dark is. Goodbye for now.

Dentre tantos desencontros da vida, mal pôde acreditar em sua sorte quando descobriu que a menina estudava na mesma universidade que ele. O que ele não esperava era que, de uma notícia ruim, surgisse uma amizade inesperada. 

Juliana sempre viveu num mundo de cores e boas ações. Ela era o tipo de pessoa que colocava a felicidade do outro acima da sua, pois acreditava que fazer o bem tornaria o mundo um lugar melhor. No entanto, mal sabia o quanto a vida podia ser injusta. Forçada a passar por uma série de infortúnios, Juliana começa a se fechar para o mundo e para as pessoas que ama, decidida a acreditar que não merece ser feliz de novo.

A história de Ian e Juliana envolve amizade, superação e a prova de que, quando algo está destinado a acontecer, não importa quantos caminhos você trace, você sempre chegará ao mesmo lugar.

85370245,The One Who Matter Most,"It began with a break-up letter eight years ago. Deidre Lewis asked her best friend Delilah White to transcribe and send the letter.
Rick Bailey, newest exit from the country town of Avery, received the letter and threw it away. In his mind, he had ended his relationship with Deidre before he left town to chase his dreams.
The extra sheet of paper in that envelope began the written relationship. 
Delilah now twenty-six, was happy with her life. She found contentment in her small town teaching the kindergarten children.
Every week her excitement came from one of Rick's letters. He had attained his dreams of becoming a rock star, and she lived a vicarious life through his letters.
After a tragic death, Rick's burnt out and fed up with his existence. He needed a rest from his fans, the constant demand of recording, and he was over touring.
When Delilah offers her home as a retreat for him, neither of them is prepared for the consequences. From cheeky fathers to a deluded Deidre, his life is as crazy as when he was touring, but now he had an urge to stay. Could he convince Delilah of that truth?",https://www.wattpad.com/story/85370245-the-one-who-matter-most,2016-09-23T20:57:28Z,2018-03-13T23:34:35Z,False,20,False,289252,24,ChickLit,1,English,False,1,"['friends', 'funny', 'happiness', 'love', 'rockstar', 'romance', 'romance-friendship', 'romancerockstar', 'wattpadstars']",216,9715,1184,https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/SandraCorton.128.639415.jpg,Sandra,SandraCorton

There should be someone in charge to lead the other in the right direction. Otherwise who knows where they will need up?""

Erin isn't popular, that's no secret. She isn't super pretty or smart. She thinks a best friend should be submissive and obedient. She doesn't have a big group of friends but doesn't really want them either. All she wants is one, perfect best friend. Becky.  She does what she is asked and never argues about it. She lives in Erin's shadow and that's how Erin likes it.

Erin's life is going fine until her principal suggests to her mom that she should leave Becky in her past and find some new friends. Suddenly Erin's perfectly constructed life starts falling apart, little by little.

Although her mother tries to explain the truth to her, she continues to  blame the world for her problems
Eventually she realises what caused her life to become undone, why it all went wrong. What the cause of all her misery is...Becky.

As she tries to track down Becky and make her pay once and for all, Erin continues to remove herself from the world and hurt the people around her. Will she realise her mistakes before it's too late? Or will she be forced into a life isolated from society completely?

                                                                                                              ~

Globular clusters are very tightly bound by gravity, which gives them their spherical shapes and relatively high stellar densities toward their centers.

140197047,Shorty (STILL WORKING ON),"4' foot 7. But everyone at Tsuyoi Gakko University makes it feels like I'm 2'7. 
Well... except Kyle.
Kyle has been my best friend since... forever. He's chill, has a casual appearance to me , but not to all the other girls. Girls think he's hot and, He's popular and I'm just... well. The short one.
Kyle is like a brother to me but for some reason a lot of people 'ship' us. And to be totally honest, I started falling for him, but ever since our first year at college , he's changed so much. He really doesn't talk to most people or act nice around most people except his little group of friends but he even gets mad at them sometimes , I'm sorta like his mom. I'm the only person he's comfortable around, I literally can talk about anything to him or tell him anything. 
Literally.
Anything.
But aside from that , he's a good person to talk to (If you really know him) when your down. 
We have tiny little fights but we will never end up not being friends, were to close.
He also knows too much.
So...
Yea.
If you don't me , my name is Ritorunelle Cha. My best friends just call me Ritoru , but if you REALLY close to me , I let you call me Ri. Like my family and Kyle. haha.

141782083,Please Save Me When I Become My Demon [Peter Parker x Harry Osborn],"Harry Osborn is your typical rich snob who's completely obsessed with himself. He is very manipulative when it comes to the people who surround. It is his habit to ruin and humiliate those people who are weak and could not look after themselves. The demon is what people typically call him. Although Harry has an awful personality, people could not turn him away. He has such a certain charisma that draws individuals in. He has issues, anger issues, that is very destructive. However, to people around him it does not seem to matter; as long as they get to taste the pleasure of being near him, they would endure any repercussions at the end.

Peter Parker is a transfer student to Osborn High, coming from another state. Though he technically he is not foreign to the place, since he spent a good chunk of his childhood in the area, they were a lot of things that changed. When he has to suddenly move states with his parents during his younger years, he did not have the chance to better look at this place with better understanding. But now Peter is back, he has a plenty of time to do that. But what he has been waiting for so long is to reunite with his childhood best friend, Harry Osborn. He has not seen him since when he left when he was 9. He is thrilled to see him now that they obviously grow and that they are 17 this year. Peter will be starting at his new school next week Monday. Hopefully, he will bump into Harry at some point. 

How will Peter react when he found out how his best friend turned out to be?

This is a story about relationships, typical teenage issues and problems and struggles.

There aren't cliques, there isn't a queen bee, and most times you definitely don't get to live a fairytale romance. Sapphire knew this stepping up to the plate, but she ignored the rules, and the rules were the easiest to follow.

If you're not rich, or extremely hot, you automatically set your place in school to where you can't converse with the people who are. The popular people, who aren't really called that, have an image that if you don't fit with it you just aren't one of them, but all sapphire ever wanted was something that was real, and lucky for her the guy who was going to give her everything she wanted was in fact, a popular.

126325867,Beautiful Chaos,"""Has anyone told you that you look like death?""

To everyone around her, Khloe Simmons is one of the lucky ones. She's tall and beautiful, a part of the cheerleading squad, and she has a boyfriend on all the sports teams. This fits all the criteria for teenage bliss. 

Well, no one is ever truly perfect as identified by three words.

An eating disorder.

She may not acknowledge the fact that she has one, but she definitely has it. She wants to spend her time in the summer under the radar, but she's forced to break out of her shell a bit when she meets Roman Calvert.

The tattooed nineteen year old is at his parents' house for the summertime. He's not perfect either, having some things wrong with him inside of his mind. He's labeled as the psycho of his family, but it's not nice to judge a book by its cover.

The mind is a beautiful thing, but the damage it does can be irreversible no matter what person claims can fix it.

*warning: eating disorders, mental disorders, drug use, and strong language are in this book.*

Athena Grace Lock is a famous dancer, singer, actress and model. (Played by Indiana Evans.) Athena is a huge fan of singer/actor Grant Gustin, and he is her celebrity crush, and gets a huge opportunity to play a character in a show he stars in, as a girl who's name is Alaska. Her hero name is Oracle, a girl who has the ability to sprout wings from her back, has heat vision, x-ray vision, and can also run at hyper speed. After a bit of time, Athena starts to fall 'like' Grant if you know what I mean. One problem... Grant is openly gay.

Thomas Grant Gustin is a famous singer/actor that stars in The CW's The Flash. Grant's celebrity crush just so happens to be a huge fan of Athena, and so when there is a new role for a superhero named Oracle, who is Grant's new love interest, Grant makes sure to save the role for Athena. (For the sake of this Fanfic, Eddie does not die, because then Barry and Iris would get married, and so Alaska and Barry couldn't be together. And also, who wouldn't ship Iris and Eddie if Barry didn't like Iris?)


Can Grant completely change his sexuality for Athena, or will Athena forever be just a girl who has a crush on a gay man.

There are so many ways to fall.
You can fall in love,
Down,
Literally,
Figuratively.
The only thing they seem to have in common is that you can't
Break your own fall.

You will land on your own fragile heart,
And it will break with the sound of
Shattering glass.
