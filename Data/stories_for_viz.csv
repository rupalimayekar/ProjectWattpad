--

On May 16, 2010, a WWII plane wreckage is discovered in Greenland. Two days later, during the excavation and investigation, a body is found comatose, protected from the elements by the plane's body. The woman is transferred to S.H.I.E.L.D. after investigation, and nine days after her discovery, wakes up.

It is discovered that her name is Amy Lamel. Amy claims to be no one special, just someone upon whom a miracle fell. But in reality, she holds an impressive stack of accomplishments: incredible aim with most guns; well-trained in hand-to-hand combat; well-versed in engineering; a member of the Army Nurse Corps and respected medical professional; and the would-be fiance of Howard Stark, had she survived the war in the usual manner.

Now Amy has to face a world where the man she loved is dead and society has evolved, and learn how to deal with all of her experiences without giving away her true past.

One of these ""rules"" for living in the modern world will be broken. Whose fault it is, and how it happens? Well, that's a whole 'nother story.

         Kameron, Grayson, Mikey, Yasmin, and Jenna have been thick as thieves from childhood. Rightfully so-they make up the American minority in the German twin city of Arabella Park. When one of the five suddenly turns up missing, the remaining friends must find a way to bring her back while keeping up the facade of leading ordinary small-town lives. 
        As they search for their missing friend, they discover things about themselves and one another that will catapult them into an explosive climax and the ultimate revelation of who done it.

Skyla must find a way back home, but that might become a little difficult when she figures out that she had developed feelings for him!
=======
Being a very rare alpha female werewolf has always made your life difficult and the last thing you needed was catching feelings for one of your fellow alpha pack members when it's painfully clear that not only does he not reciprocate those feelings but he has them towards someone else. It's true what they say - love is blind and, in your case, borderline foolish but you remain by his side as a friend, slowly dying on the inside. The question is - how long can you keep that up?

Y/N:  ""He looked happy..."" you sighed ""... and it hurts.""
Taehyung:  ""I know, sweetheart, I know..."" he said, gently cradling you ""I'm so sorry.""

Hoseok:  ""Rogue alpha. Y/N was attacked.

Y/N:  ""You're getting a mate. Why is it so wrong for me to get one too, Yoongi?""
Yoongi: ""What do you plan on doing - fucking every man in this bar? That's really cheap of you, Y/N.""

She just hadn't anticipated change would come in the form of Sloane Mayer, a girl who had seemingly nothing to lose and only one goal in mind - raising hell. 

She also hadn't anticipated that she would be caught right in the middle, put in the position of needing to track down the mysterious ""Eros,"" the mastermind behind the email.

 Even the secrets Beta Testers were unknowledgeable of, he knows of them all.

 Massive wars, life advancement, entering Godhood, sword reaching to the peak; a legend of a man becoming a Sword God has begun.

This is not my work!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jacob is a screwed up boy,  he's never had friends,  he doesn't talk,  he doesnt go to school, he dropped school to work instead, and when he goes home he plays his piano.  His life at home is not the best,  he hates it, he wants to escape, but after he meets this girl, his life changes, Jacob seems, happier? What is this feeling? He's never felt anything other than pain, regret, hate,  and depression, but happiness? 

Ally is the complete opposite of Jacob, she's happy,  she has plenty of friends at school, she loves music.  She's never felt sadness, or regret, or pain. When she meets Jacob, her life changes, she wants to help him, but he refuses help. She connects with him, and they grow great affection towards each other. 

But something happens to Jacob and Ally,  they become lost, she pushes away all of her friends, she loses connection with her family, and keeps herself locked up in her room.

I glared at him. I thought I had gotten rid of him long ago. But he's back and still wants the same thing. This guy can't take a hint.

""I have news for you. I have a Mate. I am not interested."" I said.

He smiled and said ""Oh you are cute when you're mad. That's what I love about you, sweetheart.""

I have had just about enough of him. I shifted into my wolf form and I ran at him.

Aria has left her old pack with her Mate, Lucas Moon. He is the Alpha and she is his Luna. 

Aria has been through a lot the last few years and has met and defeated many enemies. She is the best fighter and never runs from a fight. She's even come from the edge of death. 

Lucas is the Alpha of The Moon Pack. With Aria now in his life, everything is perfect. But ever since she came back from the edge of death, she hasn't been the same. And on top of that, there is an enemy who puts Lucas's pack and Lucas's title as Alpha, to the test.

In a story where old memories are remembered and old faces are known. Aria and Lucas will have to be on the alert. Ladies and Gentlemen.

Right?

Right. 

That's what Athena wanted to do.

So she went for a walk and got lost...

Just when she thinks she found hope of returning back home she gets kidnapped. 

Athena can be stupid but this girl has got guts. She figures away to escape but being cocky is in her personality. So, she wants to brag to her kidnappers. When she does, they come looking for her. 

She didn't know that she crossed a territory that was not hers to cross.

Soon, her kidnappers kidnap her again. Only, this time it's harder to escape. She's locked in a dungeon all alone. 

She doesn't know, that she's going into unfamiliar territory (literally and figuratively). 

ONE MORE THING, SHE FINDS HER SOUL MATE!

138931526,BAD BOY'S BABY | KOOKV ,"""Daddy."" 

Jungkook spit out his water all over the table, coughing as he tried to regain his breath. 

""Excuse me?"" He asked as he looked at an innocent Taehyung, who seemed to not understand the word that just left him mouth. 

""It's what Jin calls Namjoonie.""

---

Jungkook is the school bad boy and overall is dangerous. He's involved in gangs and is one of the most feared people in school. One day he does something that nearly gets him expelled but gets an offer. The offer stated that if he helped out the schools ""special"" class his actions would be forgotten. 

Of course he takes up that offer but what if he gets assigned to Taehyung? 

Taehyung has CDD - a disorder that causes him to act like a child. He's very dependent on other people because of this and is pretty innocent because of his overprotective brother.

As soon as they meet their lives intertwine.

What will happen to the couple?

Damian Rogers is the kind of guy you push past in school. Let's see he's got a stuttering issue, ugly mop hair and is as skinny as a stick. Who could ever love him? 
But then here comes possibly the prettiest boy he had ever seen. Jordan. But Jordan isn't the pretty boy he seems. He's got the looks but his underlying plan is to break whoever this stuttering bitch is. To get back at someone personally is way different than hurting who they love most. 
It's cruel and Jordan knows it, that's why he dangles Damian like an ornament on a Christmas right before the boy who loves him most, and let's him shatter on the hardwood floors.

They don't even know which of us is Ai, and which is Malfoy, me. We only have each other, and that's how it will always be.

*Synopsis*
Three identical vampire princes are searching for a human girl to one day rule their kingdom. Little did they know that Deva was not like the rest of the girls. She does everything to sabotage her chances but it isn't enough to shield her heart. Eventually the twisting and pulling force her guard down and she falls; she falls so deeply it hurts. Her vulnerability will lead her down a dark winding path she was never ready for. Vampires, a kingdom, a crown, love were just the tip of her iceberg.

126667704,El KaiSoo de YiXing [KaiSoo],"Todo empezó en la clase de Filosofía, o tal vez antes, pero yo me enteré en esa clase. KyungSoo apoyaba a JongIn en estar hablando con BaekHyun por WhatsApp. Luego, cuatro meses después se extinguió la amistad de mis dos hormonados amigos. ¿Por qué? Sigan leyendo, no tengan miedo.  

- Para mí, ustedes son como unos padres divorciados y yo me debo llevar bien con mi madrastra temporal, porque yo sé que tú -señalé al moreno, quien evadía mi mirada-, te darás cuenta de las cosas y volverás a KyungSoo, porque nadie te entiende más que él en toda tu mugre y negra vida.

Three identical vampire princes are searching for a human girl to one day rule their kingdom. Little did they know that Deva was not like the rest of the girls. She does everything to sabotage her chances but it isn't enough to shield her heart. Eventually the twisting and pulling force her guard down and she falls; she falls so deeply it hurts. Her vulnerability will lead her down a dark winding path she was never ready for. Vampires, a kingdom, a crown, love were just the tip of her iceberg.

St. Catherine's Recreational Center for young girls was, according to most in Clauford, a run down joke that not even teenage thrill-seekers would invade because the prospect of fun was drained by it's lackluster existence. Yet, one odd day, the state funded for it to be refurbished into a high school for girls. The school year started as one would expect it to, the teachers were lovely and the students were plenty. But nobody knew the new principal and her assistant. Nobody knew what would take place as the school year went on.

The year is 1759. Briony Fairborn, midwife of Everton, struggles to find acceptance after her mother's death while living in a town that ostracizes her for her scandalous origins. Her family has always been shrouded in mystery, ever since her great-grandmother first came to the small town in Orkney. With only one friend in the world, she has little hope of gaining any others, let alone finding a husband. Her life seems set on a straight course without any room for wavering.

That is, until an unexpected ship finds its way to Everton's port.

Suddenly, Briony's life becomes much more complicated. These newcomers are hiding something, and Briony soon discovers that they are not the only ones. A strange man named Niall Moreland arrives in town, a man who offers Briony the acceptance she craves. But does he know something about her family that she doesn't?

And what about the charming owner of the ship, Santiago Mendes? His interest in Briony seems to go beyond mere friendship, but could he ever love someone like her?

As Briony seeks the truth, the secrets of her heritage begin to unravel. Secrets that she may not be ready to face.

128489695,The Secret of Drulea Cottage,"""I shall always love you, my dear bairn. Remember that, no matter what happens. And you must promise me something before I go,"" Bethany whispered with all the strength she could muster.

""Anything, Mum,"" the young woman answered.

""You must stay away from the water.""

""I promise.""

The year is 1759. Briony Fairborn, midwife of Everton, struggles to find acceptance after her mother's death while living in a town that ostracizes her for her scandalous origins. Her family has always been shrouded in mystery, ever since her great-grandmother first came to the small town in Orkney. With only one friend in the world, she has little hope of gaining any others, let alone finding a husband. Her life seems set on a straight course without any room for wavering.

That is, until an unexpected ship finds its way to Everton's port.

Suddenly, Briony's life becomes much more complicated. These newcomers are hiding something, and Briony soon discovers that they are not the only ones. A strange man named Niall Moreland arrives in town, a man who offers Briony the acceptance she craves. But does he know something about her family that she doesn't?

And what about the charming owner of the ship, Santiago Mendes? His interest in Briony seems to go beyond mere friendship, but could he ever love someone like her?

As Briony seeks the truth, the secrets of her heritage begin to unravel. Secrets that she may not be ready to face.

But the devil is not alone in his hiding, for you, too, disguised your true self. You acted out the happy grandchild; the grade A, model student. You preformed as the brave, happy go lucky friend - someone people knew they could always count on to be there for them, through thick and thin. All those things, the people around you expected you to be, and so you played the parts with nimble, refined grace, dolefully accepting the labels and positions you'd been assigned.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Your every action- every word, every step- you would calculate perfectly beforehand, petrified by the possibility of being caught and exposed for what you truly are: a downcast, forlorn soul, with no more spirit than a mindless marionette.

But man can not compare to the devil's skill in show - you can't defeat the puppeteers at their own game. It is far too twisted and mystifying of a dance for you to keep up your flawless facade.

She said, and I knew she meant to end the conversation on that note. I no longer wanted to be in her presence anyways, but my legs refused to carry me away from the woman I used to admire. My mother was my rock, the one I could count on to stick up for me in any way possible. We struggled through everything together. Now, I could hardly look at her without scowling. 
     ""Thank you, Mother, for accepting the opportunity to sign away my life. I'm sure I'll be grateful someday, if I haven't already killed myself."" I said, then quickly turned on my heel and stormed out of the room. I could hardly see through the blind rage that clouded my vision, but I managed to get into my room, lock the door, and throw myself face first onto my still unmade bed.
     Letting out the sob I'd been holding in, my body violently shook as I cried for the first time since my father had died. Never have I felt there to be a reason to feel so weak, until now. Knowing that my fate was sealed to a man whom I've never met made my stomach throb and throat constrict painfully. In the end, this was be the only thing my mother ever raised me for after all. And that revelation was the hardest part to swallow.

You know Quinn Demitrius, everyone does. Perhaps you've seen her on the covers of Vogue, on the TV wining a Grammy or even shopping on fifth Avenue with her beloved sisters. She's Hollywood's hottest starlet, and the things she did to become the name on everyone's lips are merely stains on the pavement beneath her Prada heels.

With the rest if Hollywood's golden brat pack, an entire fake relationship, a mysterious blogger exposing Hollywood's elites dirty laundry, drama, scandals,cute moments and a sinful amount of bittersweet kisses.

7647757,An Unusual Mate,"Brooklyn Kelly or Brooke for short is a part of the Talkeetna Shifter Clan in Alaska because she is a shifter. She can shift into a Snow Leopard that is rather feral in character meaning the Brooklyn has little to no control over whatever her Leopard does meaning that not many people would see her as a good mate. As such Brooklyn has pretty much given up on ever finding her true mate because she wouldn’t be able to accept him as her mate because of her Snow Leopard. What really annoys her though is that the way her Snow Leopard is now wasn’t caused by her genetics it was caused by her rubbish upbringing along with her two sibling’s upbringing. 
When Loki the God of Mischief is quite literally dumped onto the clan’s doorstep Brooklyn begins to feel things that she wouldn’t have even thought she could feel and the same goes for her Snow Leopard. Well at first Brooklyn ignores Loki pretty much and argues with him to no end but as time goes on and they begin to become friends Brooklyn soon realises that her feelings for Loki are set deep within herself.
But when S.H.I.E.L.D finds out that Loki is in Alaska and has been accepted into the clan all hell basically breaks loose with Nick Fury sending the Avengers to retrieve Loki. But when Brooklyn also gets caught up in the cross fire and is taken back to S.H.I.E.L.D her Leopard turns rouge and Brooklyn looses all control and she can’t even shift back. Nick Fury eventually agrees to let Loki in with the already rouge Snow Leopard only to see if she can be calmed down.
What will happen to Brooklyn? Will she calm down? Will Loki be allowed to remain a part of the clan?
Warning: Contains a very expressive woman who swears like a sailor. A sarcastic God of Mischief. A very aggressive Snow Leopard and some scenes of the sexual nature.",https://www.wattpad.com/story/7647757-an-unusual-mate,2013-08-14T19:01:11Z,2018-03-13T23:46:16Z,False,30,False,422768,6,Fanfiction,1,English,False,3,"['alaska', 'avengers', 'bifrost', 'clans', 'leopard', 'leopards', 'loki', 'marvel', 'packs', 'shifters', 'snow', 'swearing']",107,14893,671,https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/KatieMayBloomfield.128.267160.jpg,Katie May Bloomfield,KatieMayBloomfield

Aizowa Azayaka was abandoned at the age of 7 after her father died and her mother found out she couldn't control her quirk.

When found she was sent away to QCF or the quirk control facility for kids who have been abandoned and need help as they can't control their quirks or have major problems with them.

""This is not a civil war."" 

""Then what is it?""

""The end of the Avengers Initiative."" 
***
It's been almost two years since the Revengers first landed their ship on Midgard. New recruits have joined the Avengers, while Asgard thrives in secrecy, shrouded from the rest of the Earth. Overall, it's been an eventful,  but memorable two years. Everyone is finally happy.

That is, until two brothers discover the Eye of Agamotto, and a way to bring Frigga back to life. Traveling in time, of course, has its undesirable effects, and Thor and Loki soon find themselves trapped on Asgard while the Avengers are nothing more than broken memories of the past. 

One thing is for certain. Even if they are able to restore their original timeline, they must live with the knowledge that one thing is for certain.

Nothing will ever be the same again.

""Where do you think you are going?"" Locaine's lips are mere inches from my ear. A shiver traveling from the base of my spine to the strait of my neck at his hypnotic voice.

""I don't want to play this type of game with you,"" my voice falters briefly, thoughts raking through my mind at the many possibilities to the outcome of succumbing to him. 

Locaine backs off me more or less, only to toss me around, pushing my back up against the door. His sculpted chest presses against mine as he flashes me a coy smile, ""I haven't even explained the game yet and you already want to leave.""

>>>>>>> e97a48dbabee442d09b2ea77f189b340d09ac2b4

Blaire Collins has a curse.

<<<<<<< HEAD
A curse that goes by the name of clumsiness.

Despite being confident and bold, she tumbles over anything and everything; whether it's furniture or air, Blaire is almost positive that no one can beat her when it comes to her eternal embarrassment of being a klutz. 

So, when her so-called 'curse' causes her to trip onto River Knight, the academy's richest student, and end up locking lips with him, Blaire is absolutely mortified and is sure that the rest of her life will end up with her digging herself into a hole and never coming out. 

After all, a boy like him is sure to take every chance he can get to embarrass her over the incident, right?

Wrong.

Instead of doing what most people would do, River decides to befriend the clumsy yet confident girl.

And somewhere along the way, he realizes that maybe another kiss with her won't be so bad.

Even though she's glad, she still finds herself doubting that Sasuke might actually love her. 

Follow their detailed journey and how they came to be as Mr & Mrs Uchiha 💍and how Sarada is born 👶

My take on how I think Sasusaku should be, not any major changes but a select few. 

 Will be Rated M later on because....I can't sugarcoat love scenes between these two lol this is my OTP were talking about.😂

Second is fall out of love. This type of fall commonly happens to couples, those who have labels, o nasa isang relationship. And, there are also two types of people when they fall out of love. First are those who are willing to stay. Second are those who are honest and will leave you behind.

You? What's your current situation?

""Addy, I love you and I want to be......, Addy wait..please"" that was last thing I heard from zed.

140724101,The Bad Boy's Thorn,"Malia Tate returns back to her old town after two years. She was no longer the cute chubby girl with bright pink braces and large black rimmed glasses. She's back and better than ever.

She coincidentally crosses paths her former best friend Archer Silva who ditched her for popularity - he too has gone through a change.

He was no longer the rather chubby boy with a round face and coconut hairstyle. His appearance changed massively, his hair was now styled into a quiff, enhancing the colour of his tousled brown hair. His facial structures were more defined.

Malia has plans for Archer and the rest of her former high-school classmates, she wanted them to realise how it felt to be left out.

141590868,The Unseen Immortal,"Blood. Pain. War. Those three words described his life. He never had the greed that tainted the good men of his city. And yet, he still suffered the consequences.

Perseus was a young peasant of the city, Athens. It was one of the last still Greek cities still standing. His mother was gone; she died during battle. The Persians had raided their city, leaving rubble and smoke. 

Now, Perseus had run, not because he was a coward, but to save what little he had left. His little sister.

They were different. That much their mother had told them. They were set apart. Even from each other. 

Perseus was a son of a Lelantos, the Titan of Air and Hunting. 

Phoebe, Percy's sister, was a daughter of Poseidon, the Olympian God of the Sea.

Perseus fought for his sister. Nearly died for her several times. 

Until he failed.

He was left desolate, empty, and alone.

But maybe it was for the better.

""tell me you want that."" there was a smirk on his face and suddenly it disappeared  when he looked at my lips and gulped.

""I'm allowing you."" his words choice was terrific, giving me goosebumps.

Theo has never had to work for anything in his life. Being born as the heir of a multi-million company has made that possible. Also with the help of being devilish handsome, brilliant, a billionaire, and having a body that anybody would love to worship. Except, rumor has it that he's a vile, tyrant, and heartless boss. Expects nothing but perfection, and if you fail, you're fired by the snaps of his fingers. Fear is the only thing his colleagues feel about him, and god forbid if anybody disrespected Theo.

He hid the next one that came, and the next one, until he had run out of spaces to put them. He didn't read them, he could never bring himself to, so they sat untouched from the moment they were crammed behind his wardrobe.

Soulmates where tied by two things: A Voice or touch, and flowers. 

When two soulmates where born, flowers would bloom in a place of their body, wrapping around it, growing on it, sometimes causing the disability of it. These flowers would only disappear by a Kiss for Lovers, by a hug for best friends(in case the person in question was Asexual/Aromantic). But what happens when someone Blind is meant to be the soulmate of someone mute?

The Cup brothers were also put to this rule like everyone else. The older a blind at young age, the younger born with flowers on his legs, luckily, not stopping his movement. And even like that, they managed to defeat the devil, a man blind by an eye, and a mute casino manager that turned the place he once called his, back to his old glory. 

""Cut the roses! Maiden!""

133685041,Muggle-worthy | GINNY WEASLEY,"Quinton Granger was very much like his younger sister, Hermione Jean Granger, well known for his studious nature among peers. However, there was a significant difference between the two, unlike Hermione, Quinton didn't possess magic.

He was a muggle.

Arthur Weasley has always been fascinated by muggles and their lifestyle, so when he meets Quinton one year as the older brother drops Hermione off at King's Cross, the two strike up a conversation about the function of a rubber duck. The two became fast friends and Quinton becomes a regular at the Burrow whenever his sister is invited over.

Ginny is trying to come to terms with her feelings over the Boy-Who-Lived, who doesn't pay her any sort of mind outside of being Ron's little sister. Hermione gives her the advice not to pine over Harry, that she should look at other boys, although when Hermione suggested it, she wasn't exactly suggesting her older brother.

It started off as letters between the two while Ginny is at school and becomes something each time the two see each other again.

126011866,The Vampire's Kiss,"We all have heard of our own share of people and creatures. But there is one more you have yet to hear about, these people have a very.....unnatural religion. Its people are united under one name, despite their inexplicably incomparable devotion; they are among the unholiest creations of God. The Vampiric Empire.

 18-year-old Andie Jordonson lives in a closed off city that feared creatures of the undead. The rules there were simple: no one goes in, no one goes out. But Creation had mercy on these people, as if to repay their generosity, each living being there was granted with unique powers to protect themselves against the vampires. The abilities usually show when they are 16, but Andie is still waiting at the age of 18. 

The city officials believed their work was done as they had just killed off all traces of the unholy community. Until one day, the most unlikely person in the world spoke out to the public. The Vampire Queen.

Or better known as, the Living Dark.

Her disciples are pitted against the human race, each vampire (in addition to their fangs) has their lips tainted in a deadly poison to paralyze their victims before sucking the blood out of them.

The Queen never goes out in public to carry out her own deeds, her disciples do all of her dirty work for her, Andie learns that she still had many supporters; so why does she suddenly decide to catch the attention of the public? Riled with curiosity and mourning a loss, Andie feels she has the need to prove herself, but she is ignorant to the cost; and the fact she hasn't unlocked her abilities yet. Then she will find herself sucked into a blood pool of madness, with the most heart accelerating surprise any mystery book fan could ever dream for.


I will help you along the way, in between the parts I will be giving you clues as to who the Living Dark is. Goodbye for now.

85370245,The One Who Matter Most,"It began with a break-up letter eight years ago. Deidre Lewis asked her best friend Delilah White to transcribe and send the letter.
Rick Bailey, newest exit from the country town of Avery, received the letter and threw it away. In his mind, he had ended his relationship with Deidre before he left town to chase his dreams.
The extra sheet of paper in that envelope began the written relationship. 
Delilah now twenty-six, was happy with her life. She found contentment in her small town teaching the kindergarten children.
Every week her excitement came from one of Rick's letters. He had attained his dreams of becoming a rock star, and she lived a vicarious life through his letters.
After a tragic death, Rick's burnt out and fed up with his existence. He needed a rest from his fans, the constant demand of recording, and he was over touring.
When Delilah offers her home as a retreat for him, neither of them is prepared for the consequences. From cheeky fathers to a deluded Deidre, his life is as crazy as when he was touring, but now he had an urge to stay. Could he convince Delilah of that truth?",https://www.wattpad.com/story/85370245-the-one-who-matter-most,2016-09-23T20:57:28Z,2018-03-13T23:34:35Z,False,20,False,289252,24,ChickLit,1,English,False,1,"['friends', 'funny', 'happiness', 'love', 'rockstar', 'romance', 'romance-friendship', 'romancerockstar', 'wattpadstars']",216,9715,1184,https://a.wattpad.com/useravatar/SandraCorton.128.639415.jpg,Sandra,SandraCorton

There should be someone in charge to lead the other in the right direction. Otherwise who knows where they will need up?""
                                                                                                                ~
Erin isn't popular, that's no secret. She isn't super pretty or smart. She thinks a best friend should be submissive and obedient. She doesn't have a big group of friends but doesn't really want them either. All she wants is one, perfect best friend. Becky.  She does what she is asked and never argues about it. She lives in Erin's shadow and that's how Erin likes it.

Erin's life is going fine until her principal suggests to her mom that she should leave Becky in her past and find some new friends. Suddenly Erin's perfectly constructed life starts falling apart, little by little.

Although her mother tries to explain the truth to her, she continues to  blame the world for her problems
Eventually she realises what caused her life to become undone, why it all went wrong. What the cause of all her misery is...Becky.

As she tries to track down Becky and make her pay once and for all, Erin continues to remove herself from the world and hurt the people around her. Will she realise her mistakes before it's too late? Or will she be forced into a life isolated from society completely?

                                                                                                              ~

Elle Smith a girl who could not catch a break, after two years of trying to get her crush to notice her she finally manages to stumble upon him after he runs away from the dursleys. After that werid dogs and mystrious park euipment moving is the least of their concerns. 

Sirius Black and Regulus Black the famed murderers are after Harry. They are also after Elle but no one but albus dumbledore seems to know the reason for that.

Well... except Kyle.
Kyle has been my best friend since... forever. He's chill, has a casual appearance to me , but not to all the other girls. Girls think he's hot and, He's popular and I'm just... well. The short one.
Kyle is like a brother to me but for some reason a lot of people 'ship' us. And to be totally honest, I started falling for him, but ever since our first year at college , he's changed so much. He really doesn't talk to most people or act nice around most people except his little group of friends but he even gets mad at them sometimes , I'm sorta like his mom. I'm the only person he's comfortable around, I literally can talk about anything to him or tell him anything. 
Literally.
Anything.
But aside from that , he's a good person to talk to (If you really know him) when your down. 
We have tiny little fights but we will never end up not being friends, were to close.
He also knows too much.

141782083,Please Save Me When I Become My Demon [Peter Parker x Harry Osborn],"Harry Osborn is your typical rich snob who's completely obsessed with himself. He is very manipulative when it comes to the people who surround. It is his habit to ruin and humiliate those people who are weak and could not look after themselves. The demon is what people typically call him. Although Harry has an awful personality, people could not turn him away. He has such a certain charisma that draws individuals in. He has issues, anger issues, that is very destructive. However, to people around him it does not seem to matter; as long as they get to taste the pleasure of being near him, they would endure any repercussions at the end.

Peter Parker is a transfer student to Osborn High, coming from another state. Though he technically he is not foreign to the place, since he spent a good chunk of his childhood in the area, they were a lot of things that changed. When he has to suddenly move states with his parents during his younger years, he did not have the chance to better look at this place with better understanding. But now Peter is back, he has a plenty of time to do that. But what he has been waiting for so long is to reunite with his childhood best friend, Harry Osborn. He has not seen him since when he left when he was 9. He is thrilled to see him now that they obviously grow and that they are 17 this year. Peter will be starting at his new school next week Monday. Hopefully, he will bump into Harry at some point. 

How will Peter react when he found out how his best friend turned out to be?

This is a story about relationships, typical teenage issues and problems and struggles.
This story will about two men falling in love with each other. If somehow it offends you, please leave and find another story that will satisfy your needs.

Sapphire knew this stepping up to the plate, but she ignored the rules, and the rules were the easiest to follow.

If you're not rich, or extremely hot, you automatically set your place in school to where you can't converse with the people who are. The popular people, who aren't really called that, have an image that if you don't fit with it you just aren't one of them, but all sapphire ever wanted was something that was real, and lucky for her the guy who was going to give her everything she wanted was in fact, a popular.

To everyone around her, Khloe Simmons is one of the lucky ones. She's tall and beautiful, a part of the cheerleading squad, and she has a boyfriend on all the sports teams. This fits all the criteria for teenage bliss. 

Well, no one is ever truly perfect as identified by three words.

An eating disorder.

She may not acknowledge the fact that she has one, but she definitely has it. She wants to spend her time in the summer under the radar, but she's forced to break out of her shell a bit when she meets Roman Calvert.

The tattooed nineteen year old is at his parents' house for the summertime. He's not perfect either, having some things wrong with him inside of his mind. He's labeled as the psycho of his family, but it's not nice to judge a book by its cover.

The mind is a beautiful thing, but the damage it does can be irreversible no matter what person claims can fix it.

*warning: eating disorders, mental disorders, drug use, and strong language are in this book.*

135778666,The Everything and The Bittersweet,"""Hey. I'm Athena Lock, The Everything.""

""Hi. I'm Grant Gustin, The Bittersweet.""

*************

Athena Grace Lock is a famous dancer, singer, actress and model. (Played by Indiana Evans.) Athena is a huge fan of singer/actor Grant Gustin, and he is her celebrity crush, and gets a huge opportunity to play a character in a show he stars in, as a girl who's name is Alaska. Her hero name is Oracle, a girl who has the ability to sprout wings from her back, has heat vision, x-ray vision, and can also run at hyper speed. After a bit of time, Athena starts to fall 'like' Grant if you know what I mean. One problem... Grant is openly gay.

Thomas Grant Gustin is a famous singer/actor that stars in The CW's The Flash. Grant's celebrity crush just so happens to be a huge fan of Athena, and so when there is a new role for a superhero named Oracle, who is Grant's new love interest, Grant makes sure to save the role for Athena. (For the sake of this Fanfic, Eddie does not die, because then Barry and Iris would get married, and so Alaska and Barry couldn't be together. And also, who wouldn't ship Iris and Eddie if Barry didn't like Iris?)


Can Grant completely change his sexuality for Athena, or will Athena forever be just a girl who has a crush on a gay man.

Possible triggers.

There are so many ways to fall.
You can fall in love,
Down,
Literally,
Figuratively.
The only thing they seem to have in common is that you can't
Break your own fall.
And if no one is there to break it for you,
You will land on your own fragile heart,
And it will break with the sound of
Shattering glass.

All she knew was that she was a little different, and....has a tail. Sooner or later she runs into one of the Z Fighters and starts to form a close relationship with him... 
then she's introduced to the rest of the Z Fighters and is enlightened on her race. She becomes friends with the fighters and starts training with a certain someone, whom she starts developing feelings towards. And the other developing the same kind of sensational feelings that were unknown to him.

The past few years have been tough, especially for the Z Warriors. 
This group of fighters consisted of several strong men. 
Goku, vegeta, gohan, trunks, tien, krillin, yamcha, chiaotzu, and piccolo. 
Over the years they've battled extraordinary opponents, who have decided to try and destroy there home. Battle after battles, no breaks.
It was almost like there planet was a magnet of some sort, always attracting evil. 
These last several months it's been so quiet, and peaceful. 
This was the first break from evil the Z fighters have had in a while, all of them wishing this silence could last a life time. 
Most of the fighters took this opportunity to be lazy and slack off from training. 
Others like piccolo, and vegeta where not ones to lay back and do nothing all day. Every day they would train, if givin the chance and strengthen there body's to the maximum. 
Vegeta was very...picky? He chose to be in solitude, inside of a gravity chamber. Working his body until his muscles were torn to shreds. 
Piccolo on the other hand would always look for new ways and places to train his Mind and body, but never over worked himself to the point it would take weeks for his body to re cooperate.

Kitchi, Snana, Rowtag, and Elu had stopped them with such a unique spell that it was divided into four parts. But, now, it seems as if darkness has arisen again, and I, Kieran Cox, must stop it.

33676325,The Golden Year- The Sorceress,"None of us can choose our destiny  but nobody can escape it either...
In this world of magic and chaos, Leila was left an orphan having no one left after a tragic fire. Over the years she learns how to use all sorts of weapons; the once sweet little girl had grown up to be a dangerous woman that didn't trust anyone. But things change drastically when Leila turns sixteen-years old and she is forced to serve the golden year.

The golden year gives the opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. But Leila sees it as a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love, Theo. However, Leila begins to doubt her original assumptions when she gets to know Prince Leonardo.

She is pulled into the heart of a war between kingdoms at odds. She soon discovers her magical gifts and her destiny as the 'chosen one'. She never expects to learn a new truth about her own parents and about herself.  In this sweeping fantasy about Leila's journey to fulfill her destiny and all the monsters that stand in her way. Only one monster does not have fangs or claws but he does have a powerful hold on her heart. 

Danger and betrayal, forbidden love and lust, dark secrets and enchantments threaten Leila's life and it could lead to her ultimate destruction. 
Not your average fairytale...

Te metiste en lo más hondo de mí en todos los sentidos. Realmente nunca debimos habernos quedado solos, huir y meternos en nuestras mentes.

Tu seducción me atrapó, te ganaste mis sentimientos pero yo sabía que estabas loco. Esa locura reflejada en tu mirada cambiaba de un instante al otro. Podías ser el Trunks que siempre conocí y otro Trunks que sólo conmigo salía a flote.

Me advertiste que caería en tu trampa, que era cuestión de tiempo y que me tendrías a tus sin que me diera cuenta. Ahora sólo quiero huir de tí, no debí dejar que te acercaras como me lo prometí a mí misma... Ahora eso puede ser la razón para que me ates a tí definitivamente...

¿Cómo puede ser esa bendición a la vez mi maldición? No te acerques... Tu modo de amar no es normal, no puedes quererme como si fuera de tu propiedad... Ya no seré esa sumisa boba contigo... YA NO... ¿Hasta cuándo me atormentara tu maldita obsesión?

Te metiste en lo más hondo de mí en todos los sentidos. Realmente nunca debimos habernos quedado solos, huir y meternos en nuestras mentes.

Tu seducción me atrapó, te ganaste mis sentimientos pero yo sabía que estabas loco. Esa locura reflejada en tu mirada cambiaba de un instante al otro. Podías ser el Trunks que siempre conocí y otro Trunks que sólo conmigo salía a flote.

Me advertiste que caería en tu trampa, que era cuestión de tiempo y que me tendrías a tus sin que me diera cuenta. Ahora sólo quiero huir de tí, no debí dejar que te acercaras como me lo prometí a mí misma... Ahora eso puede ser la razón para que me ates a tí definitivamente...

¿Cómo puede ser esa bendición a la vez mi maldición? No te acerques... Tu modo de amar no es normal, no puedes quererme como si fuera de tu propiedad... Ya no seré esa sumisa boba contigo... YA NO... ¿Hasta cuándo me atormentara tu maldita obsesión?

141685242,The hunger games (Genderbend) -1,"Winning will make you famous.
Losing means certain death.

The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, is a country that consists of a wealthy Capitol region surrounded by 12 poorer districts. Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.

When 16-year-old Stiles's young brother, Whitemore, is selected as District 12's male representative, Stiles volunteers to take his place. He and his female counterpart Annabeth, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives... , he sees it as a death sentence. But Stiles has been close to death before.

Only one competitor remains: Bert's Quality Meats.

Bert has owned his shop for forty years, and he's not going to sell without a fight.

So begins an epic retail war: between Sal and his monkeys, and Butcher Bert and his resourceful Viet cleanup kid Kim. Sal will stop at nothing, even if it means seducing Kim's prune-eating school teacher, in a steamy scene that will have you reaching for the nearest bucket. 

Springvale will never be the same again.

In 2004, shortly after the boys turn six, they pack up what few belongings they have and run away.

On the run for three days, they're in need of food and water. A man finds the boys and takes them in, raising them outside of the darkness and secrets of his own life. It isn't until five years later when the boys save the man's life that he finally gives them what they've been asking for: a way into the Lucchese crime family.

Every killer comes from somewhere, and this is only the beginning for the Minetti boys.

  Hearing the rustling from behind him he turned his head to the left just as I was about to make contact. 
   I went right through him and fell with a thud on the ground. Everything went black then.
   


      On a certain day when Bexley Wells is 11 she begins to see things that no one else can see, but ignores it because her abusive mother has convinced her that she is insane.
       On one fateful day she chooses to run away only to be stopped by a boy who knows something about her that she is clueless about. 
       Juggling school, work, home life, boys and her friends isn't as easy as it sounds with Bex.
       She will follow the pale boy with overgrown black hair and seemingly limitless pools of dark shining blue eyes anywhere, but even some people have their limits. 
Will Bex let those deathly limits stop her from finding out who she truly is or conquer who she is told to be and changed for the better or worse?

But, who would've know all the troubles the thing could bring her, not to mention her sudden mood swings and detachment from the outside world?

To go along with her ever growing ward of troubles, a mysterious force has been taking the lives of innocent people, increasing the death rate by loads and wrecking havoc in the world above and beneath. Tired of being accused of being the source and quite possibly ready to kill everyone herself, Corvus takes off to find the one who's been limiting her already limited free time and getting her in trouble. Can't say she particularly likes the idea of two nosy, human teen girls tagging along as well as a stubborn Angel who's hell bent on turning her in. Can't forget the mischievous demon. Throw that in there too.

141595335,By Your Side,"When Angel Miller finds himself accidentally locked in the library for an entire weekend, he doesn't think things could get any worse. But that's before he realizes that Dax Miller is locked with him.  Angel doesn't know much about Dax except that he's trouble.  Between the rumors about the fight he was in (and that brief stint in juvie that followed it) and his reputation as a loner, he's not exactly the ideal person to be stuck with. Still, Angel just keeps reminding himself that it is only a matter of time before Jeff, his almost-boyfriend, realizes that he left him in the library and comes to rescue him.

Only he doesn't come. No one does.

Instead it becomes clear that Angel is going to have to spend the next couple of days living off vending-machine food and making conversation with a boy who clearly wants nothing to do with him. Except there is more to Dax than meets the eye. As he and Angel at first grudgingly, and then not so grudgingly, open up to each other, Angel is struck by their surprising connection. But can their feelings for each other survive once the weekend is over and Angel's old life, and old love interest, threaten to pull him from Dax's side?

To survive the emotional anguish, she hides behind her vow to lead her team of demon-fighting agents-until Tom.

The new, curiously strong, agent claims she's his prophesied protector and stronger than she could ever imagine. His subtle charm sneaks through her barriers and steals her safely guarded heart. But a stinging betrayal of one of her teammates leads to a devastating battle that leaves her soul fractured.

If the team fails to find the demon responsible and restore Dakota to her former self, the millennia-old prophecy of their union will remain unfulfilled, leaving the souls of every human vulnerable.

Forgive freely and love like you've never been hurt. Don't be afraid to take chances or fall in love and most of all, live in the moment because every second you spend angry and upset is a second of happiness you will never get back.

Sarin Heyman is a princess in a world full of leather and motorcycles. She's the daughter of the infamous ""Beast"" Heyman, President of the Nightmare Assassins MC in North Carolina. A tattooer at her club's shop, Sarin, has lived the last four years of her life by one motto: Live free, but never expose your heart again.

Levi ""Phantom"" James, is the proverbial golden boy of the Devil's Henchmen MC. Gone away for four long years, Phantom finally returns to his hometown of Northridge, North Carolina. A full patched member of his father's MC and their new Treasurer, Phantom has the kingdom at his fingertips. 

There's only one catch: Northridge is also home to his club's bitter rivals, the N.A., and the only girl he's ever loved.

When the two rival clubs are forced to draw a truce to protect Sarin from a vicious group looking to invade the territory, and the entire foundation their world is built on, will Levi go in feet first or fall head over heels again? 

Can Sarin and Levi put everything they've been taught behind them for the sake of rekindling their love or will their blood keep them forever apart?

Not all fairytales are easy, especially when there are dragons at every turn.

*This is a dark romance, set in the outlaw MC world. Contains moments of mature language and situations.*

   ""If you turn around, I'll show you where my shoe fits."" I growl, pulling up my dress to show off my menacing glass slippers.

   He just laughs, running a hand through his dark curls. ""Sorry to burst your bubble, princess, but those are made of plastic. You couldn't hurt me if you tried.""

   ""I hate Disney World."" I growl bitterly, smoothing out my costume. Prince Charming gasps, placing a hand over his heart in mock surprise. ""Are you telling me you're unhappy at the Happiest Place on Earth?""

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ cover by the amazing @thatbeliever

    Do you know the worst thing about working at Disney World is? Have you ever smiled so much you've pulled a muscle? Have you ever played truth or dare with Aladdin or eaten so many dole whips you think you might puke?

Neither has Cassy Jones. But she's about too.

When Cassy gets a summer job at Disney playing Cinderella, she figures it'll be a cake walk. It can't be that hard to smile and wave at a few kids everyday, right?

Wrong. With weather in the 100's, bratty kids pulling on her dress, and her ever obnoxious co-star Prince Charming, Cassy is about to find out how unhappy the happiest place on Earth can be.

1.) Popular and dumb

or 

2.) Unpopular and smart

Usually when you get an award every year for good grades, you're considered unpopular.

What happens when their close relationship takes a sharp turn? 

Will the popular turn their backs on her for befriending an unpopular?
